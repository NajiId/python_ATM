## Skills Utilized

The skills used in this project include:

- **Python Programming:** The entire project is implemented in Python, including user input handling, data validation, and logic implementation.
  
- **Looping and Control Flow:** The project utilizes loops and control flow statements such as `while` and `if-else` to iterate through user interactions and enforce constraints.
  
- **Exception Handling:** Exception handling with `try-except` blocks is used to handle potential errors, such as invalid user input.
  
- **Data Structures:** The project uses Python lists (`drwaing_list`, `list_date`) to store and manage data related to withdrawals and timestamps.
  
- **Datetime Manipulation:** Datetime manipulation is employed to handle timestamps and calculate the time difference between transactions.
  
- **Problem-Solving:** The project involves problem-solving skills to design an algorithm that efficiently manages withdrawals within a weekly limit and handles edge cases.
  
- **Algorithm Design:** The project requires designing and implementing algorithms to validate withdrawals against the weekly limit, manage withdrawal lists, and remove older transactions.

These skills are essential for developing robust and efficient software solutions in Python and are applicable across various programming projects and domains.
